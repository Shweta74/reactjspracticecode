cdn link src use-: we are import react code into our project.

react.development.js-: core file of react 


react-dom.development-:useful for dom manupulation or it is bridge to connect react to dom

two files are created in react beacuse react used in multiple places like browser or native.

creating a element is a core thing of react.

react element is javascript object and render method is actually converting the object into h1 tag.

const heading = React.createElement("h1",
 {we can mention attribute inside this object}, 
"hello");


creating a root and render something inside it thats is the job of reactdom.

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render(heading);


react is a library so it can work on specific part also like only add react in the header section.
